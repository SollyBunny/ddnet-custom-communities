## How to add your own community 

> [!NOTE]
> Yeah this isn't anything yet, so gimme a minute

* More than 1 physical server (different IP)
* More than 3 DDNet servers (different port)
* All servers start with the community name
* Moderators which can be contacted in game or through Discord or through the web
* A discord server or website
* A community ICON similar to existing ones which looks good
* Follows master server rules

If you meet these requirements you can create a pull request with your community

Do note that these rules can be bent both ways and are subject to mine and others judgement
