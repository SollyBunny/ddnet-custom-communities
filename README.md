# DDNet Custom Communities

https://github.com/sjrc6/TaterClient-ddnet/issues/83
https://github.com/chillerbot-cc/chillerbot-cc/issues/8

People want more communities and people are slow!

## Clients implementing this

* [TClient](https://github.com/sjrc6/TaterClient-ddnet) (since 10.5.3)

## Requirements

* Some servers
* Moderators
* Reports in game, through Discord or web
* A Discord server or website in /info or MOTD
* Follows master server rules, seen [here](https://ddnet.org/rules/master/)
* Servers have /rules similar to DDNet

I prefer if
* All servers start with the community name
* You have atleast 3 servers

## How to add your own community 

1. Meet requirements
2. Create a PR with your icon and servers added to the JSON
3. Win


If you meet these requirements you can create a pull request with your community

Do note that these rules can be bent both ways and are subject to mine and others' judgement
