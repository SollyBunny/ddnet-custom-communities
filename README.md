# DDNet Custom Communities

https://github.com/chillerbot-cc/chillerbot-cc/issues/8

People want more communities and people are slow!

## Clients implementing this

* [TClient](https://github.com/sjrc6/TaterClient-ddnet) (since 10.5.3)

## Requirements

* You have atleast 3 game servers
* Some moderators
* Reports in game, through Discord or web
* A Discord server or website in /info or MOTD
* Follows master server rules, seen [here](https://ddnet.org/rules/master/)
* Servers have /rules similar to DDNet
* All servers start with the community name

Do note that these rules can be bent both ways and are subject to mine and others' judgement

## How to add your own community 

1. Meet requirements
2. Create a PR with your icon and servers added to the JSON
3. Win
